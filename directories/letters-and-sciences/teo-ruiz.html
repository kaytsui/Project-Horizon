                    <p class="faculty__answer u-margin-top-small">    
                        The most beautiful thing not so much about history per se but about teaching, is to see students discovering their world and themselves in the classroom. That sense of the new, renewed each year in the classroom. </p>
                    <p>

                    
                    <p class="faculty__answer u-margin-top-small">    
                            While the questions that history seeks to answer, usually involves examining great tragedies, as Jacques le Goff, a great French medievalist once told me, history attempts to answer the fundamental questions of who are we? Where do we come from? Where are we going? That constant search is also beautiful. Recently, I did a video for UCLA on beauty that also applies to history and what history does:


                    </p>
                    <p class="faculty__answer u-margin-top-small">    
                        Walking in the Roman neighborhood of Monteverde last fall, my wife and I saw a striking poster with just three words: La bellezza salva, (Beauty Saves)  As I teach on Zoom and watch my students struggling to make sense of the onslaught of the coronavirus, the disruptions to our lives, the ineptitude of our so-called leader, that poster’s message remains a constant in my mind. 
                    </p>

                    <p class="faculty__answer u-margin-top-small">    
                        But what is beauty? Beauty is a relative thing. It changes with shifting cultural contexts; yet when we experience beauty it always touches and becomes part of us. The world around us is full of beauty. 
                    </p>

                    <p class="faculty__answer u-margin-top-small">   
                        The heroism of health practitioners and first responders saving lives and accompanying the ill with dignity to their death that is beautiful. The poor risking their lives to keep working so that our world keeps going that is beautiful. Those of every race and age (but mostly young) demonstrating for justice and the end of systemic racism that is beautiful. The Supreme Court, unexpectedly, siding with the dreamers and with LGTBQ rights that is also beautiful.                        
                    </p>

                    <p class="faculty__answer u-margin-top-small">   
                        Most of all, when I see students, our only real future, heroically striving to learn, to keep the bonds of sociability alive, to refuse to be silent in their quest for justice that, too, is beautiful. If we are to be saved at all, it will be by the incandescent beauty of the young building, from the ruins of this world, a more humane and just future.
                        But if beauty saves then we must ask ourselves: what part will we play in rebuilding the world?  How will we bring beauty into it?

                    <h3 class="heading-tertiary  u-margin-top-medium">2) What do you think people most misunderstand about your field?</h3>
                    <p class="faculty__answer u-margin-top-small">The most difficult thing for historians is the often-voiced perception that history is about dates and remembering things. Or that the real history is that of wars and the powerful. We have moved from those point of views long ago, but it still lingers with the public. History is about questioning, about “rubbing the past against the grain.”</p>

                        <p class="faculty__answer u-margin-top-small">If by this is meant an image of a painting or a building, and since I am a medievalist, I should choose from the medieval period, I would say the cathedral of Chartres on a sunny day in winter, when there are no visitors, but if it is meant as an image that has held my interest and attention for a long time, I could think of Botticelli’s Primavera, or the view of Paris and the River Seine from the Pont Neuf looking west.</p>
